# LSTM-ON-KERAS-IMDB-DATASET

This is a simple implementation of LSTM(a type of Recuurent Neural Network) on the IMDB movie dataset provided by Keras itself.
This also makes use of embedded layers to fetch a vector that is feed into the LSTM network.
This model was able to attain the state-of-the-art accuracy.
